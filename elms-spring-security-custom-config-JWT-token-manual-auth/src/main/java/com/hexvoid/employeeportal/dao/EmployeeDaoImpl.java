	 *   as security filters apply before reaching `@ControllerAdvice`.
	 * - To ensure that the proper error response is returned, we explicitly catch `NoResultException` 
	 *   and throw a custom exception (`MyCustomExceptionClass`).
	 *
	 * Key Considerations:
	 * - `@ControllerAdvice` correctly catches the exception and prevents the default `401 Unauthorized` response.
	 * - Custom exception handling ensures that the intended error message is returned.
	 * - If Spring Security still overrides the response, review `AccessDeniedHandler` and `AuthenticationEntryPoint`.
	 *
	 * @param name The Employee name to search for.
	 * @return Employee entity if found.
	 * @throws MyCustomExceptionClass if no employee with the given name is found.
