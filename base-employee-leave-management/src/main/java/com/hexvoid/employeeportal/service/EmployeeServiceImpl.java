/**

 * EmployeeServiceImpl â€” Implementation of EmployeeService
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * <p><b>Purpose:</b> Implements the business logic for managing employee data.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Spring Lifecycle:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Marked with {@code @Service}, allowing Spring to detect and instantiate it as a singleton bean.</li>
 *   <li>Managed by the Spring IoC container for dependency injection and lifecycle management.</li>
 *   <li>This ensures business logic is consistently applied across the application.</li>
 *   <li>Acts as the bridge between the controller and the DAO layer.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Key Responsibilities:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Applies validation and business rules before DAO interaction.</li>
 *   <li>Handles business exceptions and provides a clean interface for controller usage.</li>
 *   <li>Uses {@code @Transactional} for data integrity and rollback on failure.</li>
 * </ul>
