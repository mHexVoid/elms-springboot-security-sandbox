/**
 * Service layer interface for managing leave request operations.
 * 
 * This interface acts as a bridge between the controller and the data access layer (DAO),
 * ensuring that business logic is applied before interacting with the persistence layer.
 * 
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Abstracts the DAO operations to provide a clean service layer.
 * - Ensures proper encapsulation of business logic.
 * - Facilitates easy testing and scalability.
 * 
 * Design Considerations:
 * - Interfaces promote loose coupling, making it easier to replace implementations.
 * - Implementation classes can use @Service annotation for service layer identification.
 * - Transactions should be handled at the service layer using @Transactional annotation.
